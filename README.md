# COS 435 Final Project Code
Codebase for Benchmarking Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Soccer

## Code
Uses code from [Brax](https://github.com/google/brax), [JaxGCRL](https://github.com/MichalBortkiewicz/JaxGCRL), [JaxMARL](https://github.com/FLAIROx/JaxMARL/tree/main), and [this anonymized repository](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gcrl_marl/README.md).
